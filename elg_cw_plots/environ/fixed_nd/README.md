**env_hist_nd.py** Plot histograms for the fraction of galaxies per LSE type for number density cuts: 1 plot per ELG selection for each number density and redshift.

**hist2_env_nd.py** Plot histograms for the fraction of galaxies per LSE type for number density cuts, showing together DEEP2+DESI and VVDS+eBOSS.

**tailoredcuts** Plots the cuts at stellar masses and SFR varying for each survey.

**compare_fracs** Compare the fraction diferences.

## Directories ##
**propcompare** Properties (stellar mass, etc.) compared by environment for each sample.

**tailoredcuts** Comparisson when density cuts are made to match the model ELG numbers.
